This is an attempt to create my own website to fulfill the criteria regarding the University at Buffalo's freshman seminar CSE199 and its final project. Being born and still living in the Buffalo area, I have decided to commute instead of participating in campus housing opportunities. Living at home allows me to keep a job as well as attend school full time. Currently I work in retail, with the main goal to help pay for school and other necessities of life.\r\n\r\n### Interests\r\nSpending time working on school projects or studying for my next exam is not something that I tend to particularly enjoy. When I have free time, I indulge in playing video games and appreciate spending time with friends and family. I intend on attempting to make YouTube videos sometime in the near future as another hobby. Like most people (especially teenagers,) I love scrolling through the likes of Twitter and Instagram, mostly for the laughs that come along with all of the memes that those websites contain.\r\n\r\n### Some of my favorite things on the internet  \r\n<https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubehaiku/>  \r\n<https://twitter.com/CauseWereGuys/status/754002644784603136>   \r\n<https://twitter.com/TweetLikeAGirI/status/669996092306665472>   \r\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofvFdLTik1k>   \r\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDba3L8gsYc>   \r\n\r\n\r\n### Social Media\r\nDevin DeFrank on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Devin_DeFrank)  \r\nDevin DeFrank on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/devindefrank/)\r\n",
